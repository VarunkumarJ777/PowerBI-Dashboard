# PowerBI-Dashboard-Analysis-Report

King County is served by three transit agencies, the City of Seattle, Metro Transit, and Sound Transit. The data available spans January to June of 2023. Given that it is currently February of 2023, this appears to be proposed information for planning public transit services to the county. A dashboard tool for visualizing the breadth and depth of service coverage is needed to evaluate adequate service coverage and the distribution of agency demand is needed on a real-time basis.
Based on the information provided in the data files, we can gain several decision-making insights about mass transit operations in King County, Washington: 

●	The volume of Routes, across 25 Zones, by day of the week.
●	The Number of Trips within each route, by Zone, and by day of the week.
●	The date range filter to observe seasonality in travel patterns over time.
●	Slicing and dicing across Zones and Stop Stations gives us visibility into peak demand and availability of supply.
●	Optimizing the pricing based on the above-mentioned KPIs would lead to an incremental impact on Revenue.
